# BlogApp

This project is a fully-functional blog application that enables users to register, securely log in, and create new blog posts. Each post supports embedded images and rich text descriptions. All user information and posts are stored and managed in a connected database, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval. This setup provides a streamlined, user-friendly blogging experience backed by a reliable data infrastructure.


# Setup Note:
A custom startup script allows you to initialize both the server and client environments by running npm start at the projectâ€™s root directory.
